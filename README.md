FA21 Independent Study Semester Project

Code was tested and implemented using Google Colab

Currently model was able to predict next letter or missing letter in sequence with 100% accurate even after changing the input. 

Language Used: Python 3
Project: Using LSTM Model for protein sequence prediction
Assocatiaed papaer: De Novo Protein Sequencing by Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up Tandem Mass Spectra
